In 2013’s <em><a href=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-307_6j37.pdf target=_blank>Windsor v. United States</a></em>, the Court invalidated a key provision of the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act and ruled that same-sex couples who were legally married in a start that recognized their marriage should be treated as married for all federal tax purposes. In 2015, the Court ruled in <em><a href=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf target=_blank>Obergefell v.

Same-sex unmarried partner households are often used as a proxy for LGBT households, but not without some large caveats. The <a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/18/us/18census.html target=_blank>Census currently reclassifies</a> same-sex married households as unmarried partners. There is also a known <a href=https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Census2010-Snapshot-Adjustment-Procedures.pdf target=_blank>miscoding error</a> that researchers have tried to correct for where different-sex partners incorrectly mark themselves as same-sex partners.
